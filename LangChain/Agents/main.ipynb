    "from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools\n",
    "from langchain.llms import OpenAI\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "These lines import specific functions and classes from the langchain library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `AgentType`: Provides different types of agents (ways to set up how the agent thinks).\n",
    "* `initialize_agent`: A function that sets up or \"initializes\" the agent using the tools and language model you provide.\n",
    "* `load_tools:` A function that loads useful \"tools\" the agent can use (like searching the web or doing math).\n",
    "* `OpenAI:` This is a class used to create an instance of a language model (LLM) provided by OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we create a language model (often called LLM) using OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `temperature=0:` The temperature setting controls randomness in the responses. A value of 0 means the responses will be consistent and less random.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple Example:** Think of it as setting a machine to always follow a recipe exactly without improvising.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tools = load_tools([\"serpapi\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\"serpapi\":` A tool that likely helps the agent perform web searches (for example, looking up real-world data like GDP).\n",
    "* `\"llm-math\":` A tool that helps the agent perform mathematical calculations using the language model.\n",
    "* `llm=llm:` Since the \"llm-math\" tool uses the language model to do its work, we pass in our previously created LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple Example**: Imagine giving a student both a calculator (for math) and access to a library (for looking up information).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```pyhton\n",
    "agent = initialize_agent(\n",
    "    tools, \n",
    "    llm, \n",
    "    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, \n",
    "    verbose=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This line sets up (or \"initializes\") an agent with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `tools:` The set of tools (web search and math) the agent can use.\n",
    "* `llm:` The language model that helps the agent understand and generate responses.\n",
    "* `agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION:` This tells the agent to use a specific strategy called \"Zero Shot React Description.\"\n",
    "* `Zero Shot:` Means the agent can handle tasks without needing extra examples or training for that particular task.\n",
    "React Description: The agent explains its reasoning as it goes.\n",
    "* `verbose=True`: This makes the agent print out detailed information about what it's doing, which is useful for understanding and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple Example:** Imagine a robot that not only does tasks but also explains each step it takes, and you can see all the details of what it's thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "agent.run(\"What was the GDP of US in 2022 plus 5?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, we ask the agent a question:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The question is: \"What was the GDP of US in 2022 plus 5?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent will use its tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It might use \"serpapi\" to look up the actual GDP data.\n",
    "* Then use \"llm-math\" to perform the addition (adding 5 to the GDP value).\n",
    "* **Simple Example:** It’s like asking your smart assistant, \"What is the price of an item plus 5 dollars?\" The assistant first finds the price and then adds 5 to it before answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The code sets up an intelligent agent with both web search and math capabilities using a language model.\n",
    "* The agent is then used to answer a question that involves both looking up real-world data and performing a calculation.\n",
    "* Each part of the code builds towards creating a tool that can fetch information and compute answers on the fly."

      "\n",
      "1. **Corn is King**: Corn, or maize, is a staple in Mexican cuisine and has been cultivated in Mexico for over 7,000 years. It's used to make tortillas, tamales, atole, and many other dishes. The Mexican word for corn, \"elote,\" is also used to refer to the ears of corn themselves.\n",

There are many variations of mole, with the most famous being Mole Poblano, which originated in the city of Puebla. The legend goes that nuns created this sauce in the 17th century, but they ran out of ingredients and had to use what they had, including chocolate.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **The World's Largest Democracy**: India is the world's largest democracy, with over 1.3 billion people. It gained independence from British rule on August 15, 1947, and has since become a republic with a parliamentary system of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **A Land of Many Languages**: India is home to two major language families: Indo-Aryan and Dravidian, with over 20 official languages and hundreds of dialects. Hindi and English are the two official languages at the federal level, but each state has its own official language(s). The Constitution of India recognizes 21 scheduled languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Taj Mahal - A Wonder of the World**: The Taj Mahal, a white marble mausoleum located in Agra, is one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. It was commissioned by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1632 to house the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of visitors each year.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **The Origin of Chess**: Chess, one of the world's most popular strategy games, originated in northern India in the early 7th century during the Gupta Empire. It was then known as \"chaturanga,\" which is Sanskrit for \"four divisions of the military\" – infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariotry, represented by pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **The World's First Grandmaster of Chess**: India's Viswanathan Anand became the first grandmaster from Asia in 1988. He is also one of the few players to have won the World Chess Championship in three different formats: FIDE, PCA/Classical, and FIDE Rapid. Anand is often referred to as the \"Tiger of Madras\" or simply \"Vishy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonus fact: **The Indian National Flag - A Symbol of Unity**: The Indian national flag, also known as the \"Tiranga\" (tricolor), consists of three equal-sized horizontal stripes of deep saffron (kesari), white, and green. A navy blue Ashoka Chakra (wheel) with 24 spokes is placed in the center of the white stripe. The flag was designed by Pingali Venkayya and adopted in its present form during a meeting of the All India Congress Committee in Delhi on July 22, 1947. The flag represents the unity and diversity of India, with the colors and the chakra having significant symbolism.\n"

      "\n",
      "1. **Ancient Origins**: Arabic is one of the world's oldest languages, with its earliest known inscriptions dating back to the 8th century BCE. The language has evolved significantly over time, with classical Arabic, the language of the Quran, being the most ancient form still in use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Script and Direction**: Arabic is written from right to left, unlike many other languages. Its script is cursive, meaning that letters are connected when written. The Arabic alphabet consists of 28 letters, all of which are consonants. Vowels are indicated by diacritical marks, but these are often omitted in formal writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Global Influence**: Arabic is the official language of 26 countries and is spoken by over 300 million people worldwide. It's the liturgical language of Islam, and its influence can be seen in many other languages, including English. For instance, words like \"algebra,\" \"coffee,\" and \"magazine\" all have Arabic origins.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Poetic Tradition**: Arabic has a rich poetic tradition that dates back to pre-Islamic times. Poets like Imru' al-Qais, Antara, and Labid are celebrated for their works, which often revolve around themes of love, war, and nature. This tradition continues today, with modern Arabic poetry being highly valued and influential.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Dialectal Diversity**: While there's a standardized form of Arabic used in media, education, and official documents (Modern Standard Arabic), there are many dialects spoken across the Arab world. These dialects can vary significantly from one another, sometimes making it difficult for speakers of different dialects to understand each other. Some of these dialects, like Egyptian Arabic and Levantine Arabic, are widely understood due to their use in media and entertainment.\n"

      "Human: Mexican\n",
      "AI: Tell me about Mexican 5 intresting facts. Mexican cuisine is a blend of indigenous Mesoamerican cooking with European, African, and Asian influences. Here are five interesting facts about Mexican cuisine:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Corn is King**: Corn, or maize, is a staple in Mexican cuisine and has been cultivated in Mexico for over 7,000 years. It's used to make tortillas, tamales, atole, and many other dishes. The Mexican word for corn, \"elote,\" is also used to refer to the ears of corn themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mole Sauce**: Mole is a complex sauce made from a variety of ingredients, including chilies, chocolate, spices, and sometimes fruits or nuts. There are many variations of mole, with the most famous being Mole Poblano, which originated in the city of Puebla. The legend goes that nuns created this sauce in the 17th century, but they ran out of ingredients and had to use what they had, including chocolate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Chili Peppers**: Mexico is the birthplace of the chili pepper, with over 100 varieties grown in the country. These peppers are used in a wide range of dishes, from salsas and moles to soups and stews. The spiciness of Mexican food can vary greatly, from mild to extremely hot.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Street Food**: Mexican street food is a vibrant and important part of the country's culinary culture. Tacos, tortas, elote (grilled corn on the cob), and churros are just a few examples of the delicious treats you can find on the streets of Mexico. Street food is often prepared fresh and can be quite affordable.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Ancient Ingredients**: Many ingredients used in Mexican cuisine today were first cultivated or used by ancient Mesoamerican civilizations like the Aztecs and Mayans. These include ingredients like amaranth, chia seeds, epazote, and various types of beans and squash. These ancient ingredients are not only nutritious but also play a significant role in Mexican culinary history and tradition.\n",
